Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and analyzing a dataset. In this intermediate-level task, we will perform EDA on a dataset related to terrorism. The objective is to gain insights and explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

To begin, we will import the necessary libraries and load the terrorism dataset. Next, we will examine the structure of the data, including the columns, data types, and missing values. We will handle any missing data appropriately based on the context.

Then, we will proceed to explore various aspects of the data through visualizations and summary statistics. This may include analyzing the number of attacks over the years, identifying regions with the highest terrorist activities, examining the types of weapons used, and investigating the target types of these attacks.

Furthermore, we can delve deeper into specific areas of interest, such as understanding the correlation between the number of casualties (killed and wounded) and different factors like attack type, location, or terrorist group. We can visualize this information using bar charts, scatter plots, or other suitable visualizations.

Throughout the analysis, we will focus on interpreting the findings and drawing meaningful conclusions. This may involve identifying trends, hotspots, or patterns that can provide valuable insights into terrorist activities.

Overall, this intermediate-level EDA task on terrorism data aims to enhance our understanding of the dataset and uncover key insights that can contribute to a better understanding of terrorism and aid in developing effective countermeasures.
